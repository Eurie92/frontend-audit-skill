## 🗺️ Frontend Architecture & Component Lookup Rule
For all UI, component, route, or color theme tasks (including screenshots and visual bug reports):
1. **Instant Atlas Lookup**: The FIRST tool call MUST be `view_file` on `docs/frontend-atlas/01_ROUTES_AND_PANELS_MAP.md` (or relevant atlas file in `docs/frontend-atlas/`). It indexes all routes, page files, and imported components with 0ms runtime overhead.
2. **Strict Prohibition on CLI/Grep for Lookups**: Do NOT run full-codebase grep searches and do NOT spawn CLI scripts (`npx tsx scripts/audit-frontend.ts`) for simple lookups. The atlas is already written on disk as Markdown—read the file directly.
3. **Continuous Sync**: At the completion of every frontend modification, execute `npm run audit:frontend` to keep the atlas 100% synchronized for subsequent tasks.

## 🛠️ Available Commands
- `/frontend-audit` or `npm run audit:frontend`: Regenerates the entire Frontend Atlas.
- `npx tsx scripts/audit-frontend.ts --watch`: Live file watcher for continuous background sync.
- `npx tsx scripts/audit-frontend.ts --dead`: Scans for potential orphaned components.
